				<h2>Passion Funding Passion</h2>
				<p>The type of businesses that will be funded are niched to the service industries, specifically trade services that specialize in empowering women. Many disagree with the traditional college path and decide to learn a trade then start a business. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small businesses account for 44% of the economy in 2019. But, approximately 20% percent of businesses fail within the first year. We believe that this is due to the lack of resources in education, mentorship, and funding. We believe that brilliant minds come from all social classes and everybody deserves tools, resources, and an opportunity to build a network that is mutually beneficial.</p>

The story of you, story of me, story of us and how this is a part of our journey helping the world be a better place without sounding too hippie dippie bc money is infinite and abundant so why not share it with people who want to do something instead of wasting it on taxes and keep kids off the streets… I know the numbers are high and big but fuck it let’s just go for it and see what happens #faithinhumanity</p>
